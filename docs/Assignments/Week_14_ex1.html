  <h1>Pink(singer)</h1>
  <p>Contrasting her edgy, tomboyish style with that of her female pop star peers, Pink has had huge success with hits like "There You Go," "Raise Your Glass" and "What About Us."</p>

    <h2>Who Is Pink?</h2>
    <p>Singer Pink is best known for her edgy pop music. She delivered a strong debut album with Can't Take Me Home in 2000, and achieved superstardom as a co-vocalist on "Lady Marmalade," from the 2001 Moulin Rouge! soundtrack. Some claim that Pink changed the scope of pop music and paved the way for artists like Katy Perry and Lady Gaga but has received little recognition for it. She has continued to churn out chart-topping hits like "So What" and "Raise Your Glass," and is a prominent animal-rights campaigner for PETA.

	<h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>P!nk (pronounced Pink) was born Alecia Beth Moore on September 8, 1979, in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. Pink, as she's otherwise known, gets her name from the movie Reservoir Dogs, a film she saw as a teenager and whose character Mr. Pink is someone her friends all agreed she resembled.

Pink was the second child born to Jim and Judy Moore. She experienced a largely typical middle-class life in a suburb of Doylestown, Pennsylvania. Her parents' tense relationship, however, caused the couple to divorce when Pink was three. Their split and the subsequent demise of the marriage sparked, in part, a rebellious attitude from Pink. "I was never allowed to go over to any of my friends' houses when I was little, because I was a bad influence," she said of her early life. "None of their parents liked me and my own parents were scared to death of meâ€” and for me."
