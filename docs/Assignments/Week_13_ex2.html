		<h3>2004–2008: Career beginnings and Taylor Swift</h3>
		<p>
			In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, 
			Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers, and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.
			They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.
			Rose thought the sessions were "some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, 
			I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say.
			And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks." Swift became the youngest artist signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house
			but left the Sony-owned RCA Records at the age of 14.
			She recalled: "I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through."
