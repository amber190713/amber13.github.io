<p class="a">Taylor Swift - All Too Well</P>
<div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xmaGCcfGTI">listen now</a></div>
<p class="b">I walked through the door with you<br>
The air was cold<br>
But something about it felt like home somehow<br>
And I, left my scarf there at your sister's house<br>
And you've still got it in your drawer even now<br>
Oh, your sweet disposition<br>
And my wide-eyed gaze<br>
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate<br>
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place<br>
And I can picture it after all these days<br>
And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more<br>
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all<br>
'Cause there we are again on that little town street<br>
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me<br>
Wind in my hair, I was there<br>
I remember it all too well</p>
